		<p style="font-size:15px;">This website is an Open Institute ‘side-nyake’ (Kiswahili slang for side projects). We do side-Nyake projects because we think their are fun, because they help us to strengthen our knowledge in different aspects - data, code and most importantly the subject matter (in this case, we all have learnt a lot of detail about the sustainable development goals). </p>
		<p style="font-size:15px;">Our hope in doing this project is to do some applied learning to enable us have conversations about how to monitor the sustainable development goals over the next 15 years. We welcome the partnership of other organisations who care about this issue (and who may know more about it than us) to help improve this tool. </p>
<p style="font-size:15px;">
This website is currently in alpha. We are still working on it. We still have much to do to curate data, to code, to improve the data visualisations, to get more data (See the data we currently have on the Data Catalogue). As we continue to work on it, we shall keep you updated using this page both on tech and data updates. If you have some skills that you would like to share in any respect, please do contact us - the more the merrier.</p>
